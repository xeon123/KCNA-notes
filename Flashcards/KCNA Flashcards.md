How do you deploy a Helm Chart? :: `helm install flappy-app <chart-file>.tgz` #flashcard #kubernetes #helm

Whatâ€™s the benefit of Helm Charts? :: Easy deployment, upgrades, and scaling. #flashcard #kubernetes #helm

Whatâ€™s the role of a service mesh? :: Manages secure, reliable microservice communication. #flashcard #cloudnative #servicemesh

What are the two parts of a service mesh? :: Data Plane (proxies) and Control Plane (manages proxies). #flashcard #cloudnative #servicemesh

Whatâ€™s a sidecar proxy vs. host node proxy? :: Sidecar attaches to services; host node runs at node level. #flashcard #cloudnative #servicemesh

What are key benefits of service meshes? :: Security, access control, observability, reliability. #flashcard #cloudnative #servicemesh

Whatâ€™s the Service Mesh Interface (SMI)? :: Unified API for managing traffic and metrics. #flashcard #cloudnative #servicemesh #openstandards

What is observability in cloud-native systems? :: Determines system state via telemetry (logs, metrics, traces). #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

What are the three pillars of observability? :: Logs, Metrics, Traces #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

What do alerts do in observability? :: Provide early warnings of anomalies or failures. #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

Whatâ€™s the role of OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry? :: Provide APIs/tools for tracing and telemetry. #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

How do logs help in observability? :: Record events for troubleshooting and analysis. #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

What are the types of metrics? :: Gauges, Counters, Meters, Histograms #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

What do traces provide in a distributed system? :: Visibility into request latency and bottlenecks. #flashcard #cloudnative #observability

What is Prometheus? :: Open-source CNCF tool for monitoring/alerting with PromQL. #flashcard #prometheus #observability

What are key features of Prometheus? :: PromQL, autonomous nodes, push-pull data collection. #flashcard #prometheus #observability

What is Grafana? :: Platform for visualizing metrics from Prometheus and other sources. #flashcard #grafana #observability

How do Prometheus and Grafana enhance Kubernetes observability? :: Offer monitoring, visualization, and alerting. #flashcard #kubernetes #prometheus #grafana #observability

Whatâ€™s the kube-prometheus-stack? :: Helm chart for Prometheus/Grafana setup in Kubernetes. #flashcard #kubernetes #prometheus #helm

What components are installed with kube-prometheus-stack? :: Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager, Node Exporter, Kube-State-Metrics, Grafana #flashcard #kubernetes #prometheus

How do you access Prometheus UI after installation? :: `kubectl port-forward service/<prometheus-service> 9090:9090` #flashcard #kubernetes #prometheus

Whatâ€™s an example PromQL query for pods per namespace? :: `sum by (namespace) (kube_pod_ips)` #flashcard #prometheus #observability

How do you import dashboards in Grafana? :: Use IDs (e.g., 15759) and select Prometheus data source. #flashcard #grafana #observability

Whatâ€™s a key principle of cloud-native cost management? :: Flexibility to allocate resources across clouds. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement

How can you optimize resource usage? :: Review consumption, remove unused resources, design for autoscaling. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement

What are on-demand instances? :: Resources provisioned as needed; flexible but costly. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement

What are reserved instances? :: Long-term commitments; cost-effective but less flexible. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement

What are spot instances? :: Bid for unused resources; cheap but terminable. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement

Whatâ€™s the risk of lift-and-shift in cloud migration? :: Over-provisioning without reevaluating needs. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement

How does autoscaling help with costs? :: Adjusts resources to demand, reducing idle costs. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement #autosscaling

What does KubeCost do? :: Monitors and manages Kubernetes-specific costs. #flashcard #kubernetes #costmanagement

How does cloud anomaly detection aid cost management? :: Identifies unusual usage to prevent overruns. #flashcard #cloudnative #costmanagement
