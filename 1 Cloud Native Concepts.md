# Cloud Native Concepts

## What is Cloud Native?

### **Definition**

- Combines "cloud" (inclusive of public, private, and hybrid cloud environments) and "native" (designed for or built into a given system to enable scalability, resilience, and manageability). #cloud-native
- Represents a collection of philosophies rather than a binary state.

### **Philosophies**

- **Cloud Native Architecture**: Applications are built with best practices to run across diverse cloud environments. #architecture #cloud-native
- **Cloud Native Culture**: Promotes organizational changes and optimal practices for design and implementation. #devops #culture

### Benefits of Cloud Native

- Aligning with cloud-native practices ensures applications:
  - Utilize cloud infrastructure effectively. #cloud-infrastructure
  - Achieve resilience, scalability, automation, and security. #resilience #scalability #automation #security
  - Progress beyond basic cloud hosting.
  - Built using **Infrastructure-as-Code** tools like Terraform for vendor-agnostic management. #IaC #Terraform
  - Benefits:: Scalability, Resilience, Automation, Security, Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)

### Misconceptions About Cloud Native

- Running in the cloud doesn‚Äôt inherently make an application cloud native. #misconceptions
- Using containers is beneficial but doesn‚Äôt automatically qualify an application as cloud native unless best practices are followed. They are a positive step toward Cloud Native. #containers

### Key Practices in Cloud Native Development

- **Automation**: Setup and delivery processes are automated. #automation
- **Resilience**: Applications are designed to handle failures gracefully. #resilience
- **Scalability**: Workloads adapt automatically to operational demands. #scalability
- **Security by Default**: Applications ensure robust security measures. #security

### Challenges Addressed by Cloud Native

- Single system errors. #fault-tolerance
- Host resource limitations. #performance
- Issues like "noisy neighbors" in shared environments. #multitenancy

### Ecosystem and Governance

- **Linux Foundation**:
  - Established in 2000 to standardize Linux and promote its adoption. #LinuxFoundation
  - Sponsors and promotes significant open-source projects, including **Kubernetes**, the **Linux Kernel**, and CNCF. #opensource #Kubernetes #CNCF
  - Provides education for **CKA** and **CKAD**. #certification #CKA #CKAD
  - Drives the open cloud movement.

- **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**:
  - Founded in 2015 to promote cloud-native technologies. #CNCF
  - In February 2015, Kubernetes reached its first major milestone with release 1.0. #Kubernetes
  - Oversees hundreds of projects like **Kubernetes**.
  - Plays a critical role in the cloud-native ecosystem. #cloud-native

### üîç Details

#### üß© **CRI ‚Äì Container Runtime Interface**

- Interface between Kubernetes **kubelet** and **container runtime**.
- Allows K8s to use multiple runtimes (e.g., containerd, CRI-O).
- Standardizes operations like **run, stop, remove** containers.

üëâ **Spec**: [kubernetes/cri](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api)

---

#### üì¶ **CSI ‚Äì Container Storage Interface**

- Abstracts away volume plugin logic from Kubernetes core. 
- Enables third-party storage providers to **plug into K8s** without modifying the core.
- Supports **provisioning, attaching, mounting, and snapshotting** volumes.

üëâ **Spec**: [container-storage-interface/spec](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)

---

#### üìê **OCI ‚Äì Open Container Initiative**

- Set of standards for **container image formats** and **runtimes**. 
- Ensures tools like Docker, Podman, containerd, and CRI-O can work with the same images.
- Provides **interoperability** across tools and platforms.

üëâ **Website**: [opencontainers.org](https://opencontainers.org)

---

#### üîó **SMI ‚Äì Service Mesh Interface**

- Standard API for **observability, traffic management, and policy** in service meshes. 
- Simplifies working with different service mesh providers.
- Still a **young and evolving spec**, not part of Kubernetes core.

üëâ **Website**: [servicemeshinterface.io](https://servicemeshinterface.io)

#### üåê **CNI** = Container Network Interface

- CNI (spec) is a **specification and set of libraries** for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers.
