- When creating containers using multistage builds in Docker, what technique can you employ to reduce the size of the final container image?
	- Multistage builds in Docker allow you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each stage can be used to perform a specific task, such as building an application or installing dependencies. By utilizing multiple build stages, you can discard unnecessary build artifacts and dependencies at each stage, resulting in a smaller final container image.
- In Kubernetes, what is a service called when it is created without a ClusterIP?
	- In Kubernetes, a headless service is created by setting the clusterIP field to None. This type of service does not have a cluster IP address and does not perform load balancing or proxying. Instead, it allows pods to be accessed directly using their pod IPs.
- In Kubernetes, which entities can utilise the immutable:true attribute to ensure that their data cannot be modified after creation?
	- In Kubernetes, ConfigMaps and Secrets can utilise the immutable:true attribute to ensure that their data cannot be modified after creation. When this attribute is set to true, any attempts to update the ConfigMap or Secret will result in an error.
- In Kubernetes, how would you enable data sharing between different cronjobs running at various times?
	- Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) allows multiple pods to access a shared storage volume, enabling data sharing between different cronjobs running at various times. By using a PVC, you can mount a persistent volume to multiple pods, allowing them to read and write data to the same storage location.
- In Kubernetes, which component is a part of the node infrastructure rather than the control plane?
