	- Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the process of installing and managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides a way to easily install, upgrade, and manage applications using pre-configured packages called charts. It is not kubectl. Kubectl is a command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster, but it's not specifically designed for installing and managing applications. While it can be used to deploy applications using YAML or JSON files, it requires more manual effort and doesn't provide the same level of package management as Helm.
- During the phase when container images are being downloaded for a Pod in Kubernetes, what state is the Pod typically in?
	- Pending State. When a Pod is in the Pending state, it means that the Pod has been created but at least one of its containers is still waiting for resources to be allocated or is still downloading its image. This is typically the case when container images are being downloaded for a Pod.
- Which Kubernetes autoscaling solution has the capability to scale workloads down to zero pods?
	- Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is an autoscaling solution that allows you to scale your workloads down to zero pods based on events such as message queue lengths or HTTP requests. KEDA uses a pull-based approach, where it periodically checks for new events and scales accordingly.
- How does KEDA enable event-driven autoscaling in Kubernetes, and what custom resource does it utilise for this purpose?
	- KEDA enables event-driven autoscaling in Kubernetes by scaling applications based on external metrics, such as message queue lengths or HTTP requests. It utilizes a custom resource called ScaledObjects for this purpose. ScaledObjects define how to scale an application based on these external metrics.
- When using kubectl apply in Kubernetes, what is a potential drawback related to tracking the state of resources?
	- If you remove resources from the applied manifest, kubectl apply may not track them and can inadvertently delete those resources. If you remove resources from the applied manifest and reapply it, kubectl apply may interpret the missing resources as no longer necessary and will delete them from the cluster. This behavior is particularly important in situations where a manifest was pruned or modified without intending to delete resources from the cluster.
- Which Kubernetes component interacts with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI)?

It provides a stable network identity and load balancing for accessing the application, allowing clients to access the application without needing to know the individual IP addresses of the Pods.
- What are the primary modes of service discovery within a Kubernetes cluster?
	- Environment Variables and DNS are the primary modes of service discovery within a Kubernetes cluster. When a pod is created, Kubernetes automatically configures environment variables for the pod's container that point to other services running in the same namespace. Additionally, Kubernetes provides a built-in DNS service that allows pods to discover and communicate with each other using DNS names.
- What are the default namespaces in a Kubernetes installation?
	- default, kube-system, kube-public, kube-node-lease. In a Kubernetes installation, there are four default namespaces that are created during the cluster setup process. These namespaces are 'default', 'kube-system', 'kube-public', and 'kube-node-lease'. The 'default' namespace is where user-deployed applications typically run. The 'kube-system' namespace contains objects created by the Kubernetes system, such as the API server, controller manager, and scheduler. The 'kube-public' namespace is used for cluster-wide information that can be safely exposed publicly without authentication. The 'kube-node-lease' namespace is used for node lease objects.
