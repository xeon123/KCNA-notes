These are my personal notes that I have carefully compiled while studying for the **Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)** certification. They represent a significant effort, time, and dedication to understanding Kubernetes and cloud-native concepts.

If you find these notes helpful and would like to support my work, consider buying me a coffee! â˜•ðŸ˜Š
