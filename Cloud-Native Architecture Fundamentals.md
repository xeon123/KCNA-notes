#### Evolution of Cloud-Native Architecture
- **Origins**: Evolved from challenges with legacy monolithic applications.
- **Focus**: Provides design patterns to improve availability, cost management, efficiency, and reliability.
- **Benefits**: Enables loosely coupled, resilient, manageable, and observable systems. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes with minimal expenses.

#### Monolithic Applications: Issues and Challenges

- **Tightly Coupled Components**:
    - Changes in one area can affect the entire application.
        - If multiple components or applications rely on the same library, updating or changing the library for one application can cause compatibility issues with others. This can lead to unexpected behaviour or break functionalities in parts of the application that were previously working fine.
    - Dependencies between libraries and components lead to fragility.
- **Installation Practices**:
    - Installed directly on the operating system using package managers like `APT` or `YUM`.
    - Shared resources increase complexity and risk.
- **Fragile Architecture**:
    - Tight coupling between the web server (e.g., Apache/Nginx), business logic, and data interfaces.
    - Difficult to make frequent and predictable changes with minimal toil.

#### Cloud-Native Approach: Advantages

## Key Cloud-Native Practices

These practices emphasize proactive design, automation, and scalability, ensuring applications are resilient, secure, and cost-efficient while leveraging cloud-native capabilities.
**Self-healing** refers to the ability of a system or application to automatically detect and recover from failures or issues without human intervention. This includes restarting failed processes, reallocating resources, or rerouting traffic to maintain availability and performance without manual intervention.

1. **Resilience**
    - Design applications to anticipate failures, incorporating self-healing mechanisms.
    - Example: In a replica set, Kubernetes automatically maintains the desired number of replicas in deployments.
        - If a pod is killed, kubernetes restarts a new replica (self-healing)
2. **Automation**
    - Reduces manual intervention with tools like Ansible and Terraform.
    - Facilitates rapid deployments and frequent updates, e.g., Kubespray leverages Ansible for Kubernetes deployment automation . 
    - Terraform is a Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) tool.
        - Allows users to define and provision infrastructure using code, enabling automated, consistent, and repeatable deployments of cloud resources across various providers.
    - Ansible is a **open-source automation tool** that is used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and multi-node orchestration.
    - This provides speed and agility through automated processes that deploys infrastructure and applications rapidly and update frequently.
        - Allows faster interactions, reduces human error, and ensures consistency across environments.
3. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** 
    - **Continuous Integration**: Frequent code commits with automated testing.
    - **Continuous Delivery**: Automates release preparation, requiring human initiation for deployment.
        - Is a practice that encourages frequent development changes with an emphasis on automated testing, leading to a release build.
    - **Continuous Deployment**: Fully automated release to production, emphasizing testing and rollback procedures, often without requiring human initiation.
    - In KCNA exams, interpret "CI/CD" as Continuous Delivery by default.
4. **Secure by Default**
    - Follow security best practices like the **Zero Trust model** ("never trust, always verify identities and integrity").
    - Utilize secure inter-service communication (e.g., Kubernetes ensures secure component connections by default (from the start)).
    - Implement **least privilege access** to minimize risks from exploited components.
        - The concept of **'Least Privilege'** is crucial for **Cloud Native security** as it helps to **minimize potential attack surfaces** and **limit the scope of damage** that can occur if a security breach or exploit happens.
5. **Speed, Efficiency, and Cost Optimization**
    - Use auto-scaling to handle varying workloads dynamically.
    - Leverage serverless architectures for scalability and cost-effectiveness, including scaling down to zero when idle.
    - Adopt proactive infrastructure design to ensure readiness for unpredictable peak demands.
6. **Service Discovery**
    - Automate detection of services on a network, avoiding manual configurations.
    - Use cloud-native tools like Kubernetes' DNS service and environment variables for seamless service discovery.

    - Speeds up the release cycle, improves productivity, and minimizes deployment risks and downtime.

### Takeaway

**Acronym to Remember:**  
"Morning Coffee Delivers Caffeine Delight" = **Microservices, Containerisation, DevOps, Continuous Delivery**.

## Autoscaling

**Auto Scaling** enable automatic scaling of infrastructure or application components based on specific metrics. This ensures that resources are adjusted according to workload demands, which is especially important in environments where unused resources incur costs. 

Auto scaling plays a pivotal role in ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated, improving application availability and optimizing costs in cloud environments.

1. **Types of Auto Scaling**:
    
    - **Reactive Auto Scaling**: Triggered when metrics hit predefined thresholds. For example, if CPU usage exceeds a threshold, the system automatically adds resources. When the demand decreases, resources are scaled back down.
    - **Scheduled Auto Scaling**: Scaling is based on known future demand. This is useful when there are predictable spikes, such as end-of-month processing or periodic events like sales promotions.
    - **Predictive Auto Scaling**: Uses AI and machine learning to anticipate future scaling needs based on historical data. It allows the system to "predict" demand and scale in advance, minimizing the impact of latency during scaling events.
2. **Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling**:
    
    - **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)**: Involves increasing the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) of an existing server or virtual machine. While this is feasible with virtual machines, it may require downtime and has physical limitations. E.g., in VMware ESXi, scaling down may incur a power down or a reboot of the resource, depending on the strategy used.
        - The addition or removal of resources in relation to the physical resources.
    - **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)**: Involves adding or removing instances or nodes, typically in a cloud-native context. This is often more flexible and scalable than vertical scaling, especially in distributed applications.
        - The addition or removal of resources in relation to the existing resources.
    - In cloud native environments, horizontal scaling is used more.
        - Unused resources, such as idle virtual machines or storage, typically incur costs even if they are not being utilized.
    - Automation is a key component when using scaling.
    - Testing should be part of the autoscaling solutions. Horizontal scaling increases complexity of data sharing. More resources = more routes between resources and increased concurrency.
3. **Kubernetes Auto Scaling**:
    
    - **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts the size of a Kubernetes cluster based on workload demand, adding or removing nodes as needed.
    - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in a deployment based on resource usage (e.g., CPU or memory).
        - The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes automatically scales the number of replicas of a pod based on observed metrics such as CPU utilization or custom metrics. This helps ensure that the application can handle varying loads efficiently by adjusting the number of pod instances dynamically.
    - **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**: Adjusts the resource requests and limits for individual pods based on their observed usage.
        - Vertical Pod Autoscalers (VPA) automatically adjust the resource requests and limits (such as CPU and memory) for containers in a pod based on their usage patterns. This helps ensure that the pod has the appropriate amount of resources, improving performance and resource utilization.
    - **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling)**: A solution for event-driven applications that scales based on events, and can even scale to zero, which is useful for saving costs.
        - It allows applications to scale based on external event sources, such as message queues or databases, using custom resources called ScaledObjects to define scaling criteria and behaviour.
4. **Considerations**:
    
    - Autoscaling accelerates application availability and access. 
    -  Always add automation as an appropriate action
    - **Automation**: Essential for achieving speed, consistency, and cost-efficiency in auto scaling.
    - **Testing**: Ensure that your applications can scale correctly and maintain performance under increased load. 
    - **Complexity of Data Sharing**: As scaling increases the number of resources, managing data consistency and concurrency becomes more complex.

## Serverless Computing

Serverless computing still involves servers, but are managed by a service provider. Users don't manage or maintain servers, focusing instead on deploying code or container images. The provider handles provisioning, scaling, and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, reducing complexity and cost for users.

**Core Features of Serverless**

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
    - Serverless applications operate in response to events, such as HTTP requests or changes in data.
    - Billing is based on resource usage during code execution.
2. **Auto-Scaling**:
    - Serverless platforms automatically scale applications from zero to accommodate demand.
    - This eliminates manual scaling configurations but requires budget considerations to manage costs effectively.
3. **Abstracted Infrastructure Management**:
    - Users don't need to worry about infrastructure details such as memory, CPUs, operating systems, or patching.
- Code execution and autoscaling are the two most critical factors that affect costs in serverless computing.
	- In a serverless model, you are charged based on the number of function executions and the time taken to execute them (code execution).
	- Autoscaling, which dynamically adjusts resources based on demand, ensures that you only pay for the resources used, which directly impacts costs.
		- Scale to zero" means that a serverless service can automatically scale down to zero active instances when there is no demand, reducing costs to zero when the service is not in use. => allow cost efficiency by not charging for idle resources.
		- Budget thresholds allow users to set spending limits and receive alerts when costs approach or exceed predefined budgets. This helps monitor and control costs associated with serverless offerings by providing visibility and proactive management of expenses.

**Example: AWS Lambda**  
![[Cloud-Native Architecture Fundamentals Serverless Overview.png]]
AWS Lambda is a leading serverless offering, classified as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). Users can upload code or container images, and Lambda automatically executes them in response to events. 
- Automatic response to requests at any scale.
- Built-in concurrency management (provisioned concurrency)
	- Multiple number of instances can run simultaneously. It ensures that functions are pre-initialized and can serve requests with minimal latency, even under high demand.

**Open Source Serverless Options**  
In the cloud-native ecosystem, platforms like **Knative** and **OpenFaaS** provide FaaS functionality on Kubernetes.
- Applications can automatically scale pods based on usage.
- Serverless applications can integrate load balancers and scale from zero based on demand.

**Challenges in Serverless**
1. Proprietary solutions often lack standard APIs, making interoperability challenging.
	1.  Each cloud provider has its own set of APIs, features, and service integrations, which can make it difficult to migrate applications from one provider to another or adopt a multi-cloud strategy.
2. The **CloudEvents specification** by CNCF provides a standardized format for event data, enabling consistent communication across platforms and systems.
	1. Hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation
	2. SDKs in Go, Java, etc…
	3. Specifications covering AMQP, HTTP, JSON, Kafka, etc…
3. Serverless architecture can incur latency during periods of inactivity due to the "cold start" issue. When a serverless function is invoked after a period of inactivity, the infrastructure may need to initialize a new instance of the function, causing a slight delay before the function is executed.

### Recommendations

- Explore AWS Lambda's features for understanding FaaS capabilities.
- Familiarize yourself with **CloudEvents** to ensure interoperability in serverless solutions.
- Consider open-source tools like Knative for Kubernetes-based serverless applications.

### **Examples and Their Impact**

1. **Open Container Initiative (OCI)**:
    - Established in 2015 by Docker Inc., CoreOS, and others under the Linux Foundation.
    - Docker has indeed been instrumental in the creation of Open Standards and Open Contributions. The company behind Docker was a key contributor to the development of the OCI specification, which is an open standard for container runtime environments. Additionally, Docker's platform is built on top of several other open standards, including Linux kernel namespaces and `cgroups`.
    - Docker Inc donate to Open Container Initiative runC, Docker’s underlying runtime software.
        - runC was a critical component of the Docker platform at the time and provided the low-level functionality needed to create and manage containers.
        - By donating runC to the OCI, Docker marked the first open standard for container runtime environments. D
    - **Image Specification**: Standardizes how container images are created and packaged. 
        - It provides a set of rules and guidelines for creating container images that are compliant with the OCI format, ensuring that they can be used across different platforms and environments. 
            - It defines the format of the image, including the layers, metadata, and other components that make up the image.
        - Tools: Docker, BuildKit, Podman, Buildah (all produce OCI-compliant images).
    - **Runtime Specification**: Defines how to download, unpack, and run filesystem bundle.
        - The Open Container Initiative (OCI) outlines the Runtime Specification, which defines how a filesystem bundle should be executed as a container runtime environment. The Runtime Specification provides a standardized interface for running containers, ensuring that different runtimes can execute containers in a consistent and predictable manner.
        - Examples: Kata Containers, gVisor, Firecracker.
            - The reference implementation is runC. 
        - `runc` (“run contaires”) is an open-source command-line tool that serves as the reference implementation of the OCI runtime specification. It provides a minimalistic way to run containers according to the OCI runtime specification and serves as a testing ground for verifying compliance with the specification.
    - **Distribution Specification**: Standardizes API protocols for distributing container images between registries, repositories, and other systems.
        - Open standards and API protocols for distribution of content, built upon the Docker Registry HTTP API v2 Protocol
            - Provides common interface for pushing, pulling, and managing container images, ensuring that different systems can interoperate.
        - Derived from Docker Registry HTTP API v2, used by Docker Hub.
2. **Container Network Interface (CNI)**:
    - A networking plugin specification for Kubernetes and other systems.
    - Simplifies networking setup, supporting multiple implementations to avoid vendor lock-in.
    - Examples: Auto-installed in Minikube, configurable in kubeadm setups.
    - A CNI compatible implementation needs to be installed to transition the Kubernetes nodes from Not Ready to Ready.
        - Minikube will do this during setup, and optionally you can override the choice of CNI.
        - Kubeadm requires that you choose and install a compatible CNI layer as part of the installation process.
3. **Container Storage Interface (CSI)**:
    - Open standard for interfacing with storage solutions.
        -  Provides a common interface for container orchestration systems, such as Kubernetes, to interact with different storage solutions. It allows storage vendors to write a single CSI plugin that can be used across multiple container orchestration systems.
    - Examples: Rook (a CNCF project), Portworx (commercial solution).
4. **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**:
    - ![[Cloud-Native Architecture Fundamentals CRI.png]]
    - Plugin interface allowing Kubernetes' Kubelet to work with various container runtime engines.
    - Examples: containerd, CRI-O, Firecracker.
    - CRI is not exclusive to Kubelet. There are other projects that can make use of container runtime interfaces.
    - Facilitates flexible runtime usage for Kubernetes pod management.
5. **Service Mesh Interface (SMI)**:
    - Standard specification for service mesh technologies.
        - `https://smi-spec.io`
    - Supports rapid growth in service mesh adoption by enabling interoperability.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:

- Open standards provide flexibility, interoperability, and innovation across cloud-native tools.
- They allow seamless integration and prevent vendor lock-in, enabling widespread collaboration.
- Prominent examples like OCI, CNI, CSI, CRI, and SMI illustrate their influence in Kubernetes and beyond.
